### Helium is now a multi-window browser.

Getting started with Helium is easy and evolutionary with documents. Each
document or window maintains several specific attributes which are saved
automatically.

### Managing Multiple Windows

![Windows](/images/windows.png)

To drag a window, drag its title bar or content - if title bar was hidden.

### SHIFT Into Key Window

To focus a window, just hold down the SHIFT key before moving into window.

The current "key" Helium window title name is in bold text, when title bar
is present.

### Preferences Menu

Helium provides convenient access to document and global preferences via the Finder, Stauts Icon, and Dock Icon menus.

### Dock Icon Menu

Helium provides a dock icon menu to recent document and actions.

### Status Icon Menu

![Status](/images/status.png)

Document actions from the status item menu will affect the current window
or "key" (keystoke) window.  To affect a window which is currently not the
key window, use the contextual menu, or "SHIFT" into the target window.

### Contextual Menu

Each Helium window provides a contextual menu, which varies based on type of
content being displayed.

### Documents Menu

![Documents](/images/documents.png)

For content based on file URLs rather than websites Helium document window,
when a file save is possible, will allow you to save the document. All file
operations for Helium store to the user's defaults application preferences,
which are global for all documents yet individual settings per document are
captured such its window frame size, location, title. See playlists below.

### Playlists

Helium maintains two types of information: History and Playlists.

![Playlists](/images/playlists.png)

From all Helium windows, a contextual menu item, Playlists, gains access to
all recorded information stored within the users applications default store
for Helium.

Helium does provide a means to save and retrival entire playlist or items,
by drag-n-drop from the the playlist table views. Also playlist items can
be dragged from a Helium window document icon into a playlist item or list
which if "over" will cause the item to be updated.

Note that all playlists saved can be done by the playlist panel Save button
and automatically when the app terminates.

History catalogs in order of viewing, all loaded URLs be they local, remote
or web sites. This history is itself a "playlist" who name can be tailored,
by altering its name in the playlist editor.
